Below are instructions for a quickstart. For full documentation, please visit our [official Docs.](https://docs.getOmni.dev)

## Getting Started

1. Sign up and log into [Omni Dashboard](https://console.omnirpa.io).

2. Create a Project and [put in your cloud provider credentials](https://console.omnirpa.io/docs/getting-started-with-Omni-on-aws). Omni will automatically provision a Kubernetes cluster in your own cloud. It is also possible to [link up an existing Kubernetes cluster.](https://docs.console.omnirpa.io/docs/cli-documentation#connecting-to-an-existing-cluster)

3. ðŸš€ Deploy your applications from a [git repository](https://console.omnirpa.io/docs/applications) or [Docker image registry](https://docs.getOmni.dev/docs/cli-documentation#Omni-docker-configure).

## Running Omni Locally

While it requires a few additional steps, it is possible to run Omni locally. Follow [this guide](https://console.omnirpa.io/docs/running-Omni-locally) to run the local version of Omni.
