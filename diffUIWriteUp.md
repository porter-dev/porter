## Next Steps

    Given more time I would try to improve the UI and UX of the diff view functions
    - Get the diff view to show for specific UI contents like resources (WIP)
    - For helm chart diff add a right handle scroller to allow users to change diff views based on revision instead of single handedly having to click through different revisions
    - Once the diff view shows for specific UI highlight various diffs instead of simply showing the side by side comparision
